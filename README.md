# OpenWebif
OpenWebif is an open source browser-based interface for Enigma2-based set-top boxes (STBs).

## Screenshots
[Classic interface](screenshots/SCREENSHOTS.md)

(TODO: add Modern interface screenshots)

## Usage
To find out how to access it from your browser, go to OpenWebif's configuration via your receiver's Plugins page. You'll see the `http...` address to use at the bottom.

## Documentation
Read the [e2openplugin OpenWebif documentation](https://e2openplugins.github.io/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/).

Browse [OpenWebif API Wiki](https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/wiki/OpenWebif-API-documentation).

## Found a Problem / Issue / Bug / Missing Feature?
First, check whether it's [already been logged](https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/issues).

Otherwise, feel free to log a new issue or request.

** **Always try the most recent build first to see if this solves the issue!** **

If that doesn't help, please provide as much information as possible!

You'll need to enable the `Debug | Display Tracebacks in browser` setting, either:
- through `OpenWebif configuration`, which can be found via your receiver's `Plugins` page

or 

- by adding the line `config.OpenWebif.displayTracebacks=true` to your receiver's `/etc/enigma2/settings` file

Along with the information on the steps you took that caused the issue, the following will be very useful:
- whether the issue is constant or intermittent
- if it has just recently started happening (perhaps after an update)
- screenshots - a picture really is worth a thousand words!
- whether the issue happens on just one or several browsers
  - try with a mainstream browser (Brave / Chrome / Firefox / Safari / Edge)
  - try disabling browser extensions & plugins
- if you've installed any plugins which could be related to the issue

** **Note that the more detail we get, the sooner we'll be able to investigate!** **

We have limited free time and often only have one configuration at our disposable, so...

If possible, even more helpful details to include are:
- device type and OS (Mac OS / Windows / Android / Apple ...)
- OS or device version (Monterey / Win10 / Android 11 / iOS12 ...)
- browser (Brave / Chrome / Firefox / Safari / Edge ...)

## Installation

OpenWebif is installed by default on a number of enigma2 images  

* [OpenWebif ipk full](https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/raw/gh-pages/enigma2-plugin-extensions-openwebif_latest_all.ipk)

* [OpenWebif ipk vti](https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/raw/gh-pages/enigma2-plugin-extensions-openwebif_latest_vti.ipk)

* [OpenWebif deb](https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/raw/gh-pages/enigma2-plugin-extensions-openwebif_latest_all.deb)

To install the plugin manually:
```bash
## connect to your enigma2 device via SSH/Telnet, (eg. `ssh root@boxip`), then

# change to the temp directory
cd /tmp

# shut down enigma2 gracefully
init 4

# fetch OpenWebif ipk
wget -O openwebif.ipk https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/raw/gh-pages/enigma2-plugin-extensions-openwebif_latest_all.ipk

# install downloaded ipk file
opkg install openwebif.ipk

# restart enigma2
init 3
```

## Development Information

See what's been happening, check out the [OpenWebif changelog](CHANGES.md)

### Dependencies
The following additional packages need to be installed:  
_(dependencies should be handled by using ipkg/opkg packages)_

    python-pprint
    python-cheetah
    python-json
    python-unixadmin
    python-misc
    python-twisted-web
    python-pyopenssl
    python-compression

### File Paths ###
The OpenWebif plugin's files are located on the enigma2 box at `/usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/OpenWebif`

On non-dev builds, `.tmpl` files will need to be generated to .py 
- connect to the stb (eg. `ssh root@boxip`)
- manually delete the .pyc/.pyo file(s) associated with the 
  template(s) you've modified (enigma2 will regenerate them)
`cheetah compile --nobackup --iext=.tmpl -R /usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/OpenWebif/controllers/views/`
- restart Twisted server by going to `/web/restarttwisted` in the browser
or
- restart enigma2 `init 4 && init 3`
